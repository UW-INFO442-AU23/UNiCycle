            "detail1": "As the global population and economy grow, the production of materials like plastics, paper, and aluminum has significantly increased. Without proper waste management, this leads to a considerable rise in mismanaged waste, polluting ecosystems like rivers, lakes, and the ocean.",
            "thing2": "Staggering Plastic Pollution in Oceans:",
            "detail2": "An estimated 75 to 199 million tons of plastic waste currently reside in our oceans, with an additional 33 billion pounds of plastic entering the marine environment annually. This overwhelming amount of plastic, which includes the vast Great Pacific Garbage Patch, is too much for the existing waste management and recycling infrastructure to handle.",
            "thing3": "Exponential Growth of Plastic Production:",
            "detail3": "Since its inception in the early 20th century, plastic production has skyrocketed, from 2 million tonnes per year in 1950 to 460 million metric tons in 2019. A total of 9.5 billion metric tons of plastic were produced from 1950 to 2019, with about 7 billion metric tons becoming waste, half of which are single-use products.",
            "thing4": "Impact on Marine Life:",
            "detail4": "It is estimated that over 1 million marine animals, including sea turtles, die each year due to plastic pollution in the ocean. The majority of the victims are seabirds, with marine mammals also significantly affected but less visible in media reports.",
